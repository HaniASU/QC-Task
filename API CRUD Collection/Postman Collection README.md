# Postman Collection

This project has a Postman Collection  for this dummy REST API to test and try our APIs.

## What you need
- Postman (Desktop or Web)
- A Postman account (only if you want to see the Flow)

## Quick start
1. Import the Collection into Postman.
2. Choose how to set values:
   - **Collection variables** (come with the Collection), or
   - **Environment variables** (you create/choose an Environment).
3. Turn on the right Environment (if you use one).
4. Send a request, or use **Collection Runner** to run many requests.

> **Note about variable priority**
> If the same variable name exists in both **Environment** and **Collection**, Postman uses the **Environment** value.

## Validation scripts (important)
Each request includes simple scripts to help you:
- **Test scripts** run after the request. They check:
  - Status code is OK (2xx)
  - Response time is reasonable
  - Response body has the main fields we expect (when known)
  The results appear in the **Test Results** panel (and in the **Runner**).

> Tip: You can see or edit these scripts in the **Pre-request Script** and **Tests** tabs for each request.

## Flow
You can view the Flow here:

1. Open the Collection.
